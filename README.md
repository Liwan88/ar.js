# Developing Tenken Application
Tenken application is pure html/css/js web application that needs to be hosted on some web server. Source code is located at applications/Tenken/ar_browsersource/

1. Download entire directory of applications/Tenken/ar_browsersource/
2. With your favorite web server, host the above files (we'll assume http://localhost:8080/tenken)
3. Start mobile application. In the first dialog to specify "Server URL", put http://localhost:8080/tenken
4. Change html/css/js files with your favorite editor

Note: **Tenken application will cache html/css/js files in the device. Whenever you change the same html/css/js files, you would need to force to reload the pages from the web server.** One way to do this is clearing the web cache by tapping settings while running Tenken, where you will see button to "Clear Web Cache"
